  Lavos

Matti Henttonen (collateralburger): Synth & music
Vantte Kilappa (Warma):             'Lavos' shape code
Tatu Kilappa (Trilkk):              All other code

FreeBSD-ia32 16k intro for Tokyo Demo Fest 2014 combined intro compo. However,
entered as wild since the TDF intro compo is Windows-only. Windows and Linux
ports exist at the time of writing this README, but they do not quite fit into
16k. Or any other size limit for that matter.

The premise for this production was for collateralburger to try out programming
a software synthesizer for the first time. Rest of the intro has been made to
accomodate. 4k synth would have been quite unreasonable for a first entry into
introcoding, so the 16k limit serves as a more lax restriction.

Greets in the intro for once.
